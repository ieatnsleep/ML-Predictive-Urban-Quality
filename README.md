# Predictive Urban Quality ML analysis for Movehub Rating

Skills Demonstrated:

### Data Preprocessing & Exploration:
Conducted thorough analysis to understand the distribution of crime rating, Purchase Power, Health Care, Pollution, Quality of Life and Movehub ratings, identifying potential trends and correlations.

### Predictive Modeling: 
Implemented as a baseline model to establish a straightforward relationship between Purchase Power and Crime Rating, providing initial insights into the data's linear patterns.

### Statistical Analysis:
- Utilized statistical measures to evaluate model performance, including R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the models' predictive capabilities.

### Data Visualization: 
Created scatter plots and regression lines to visually represent the models' predictions compared to actual data.
3D scatter plots were also created to better visualise the model's prediction compared to the data.

### Feature Engineering:
Generated polynomial features to extend the model's capacity to capture the nuanced effects of Purchase Power and Crime Rating, demonstrating the value of feature transformation in predictive modeling.
Adjustments of labels and features into Purchase Power & Pollution vs Movehub Rating to better capture a linear relationships between these metrics.
Cross-validations were explored, together with LeaveOneOut.
